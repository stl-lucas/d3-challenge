<h3>Author: Tim Lucas</h3>
<h6>WUSTL Data Analytics Bootcamp homework Week 16</h6>

<p>In this assignment we were tasked with building a Scatterplot using D3. We were given some filler text and a csv data file and needed to read the data using d3 and then plot accordingly. Some of the design requirements included building out the axis and labels, scalding the data to fit the plot, and add the state abbreviations to the scatter markers.</p>

<h6>Step 1</h6>
<p>Use the D3 library to read in the provided data set stored in a csv file. Then manually create the scatter plot with D3.</p>

<p>Add the axis and marker labels.</p>

<h6>Bonus</h6>
<p>Add tooltips so that hovering over each marker would provide the exact state name and details.</p>
